# Open Design Tasks

Next steps:
- Define base starting presets (example 3 presets) using multiples of 5.
- Draft 5 starter abilities with deterministic effects + mana costs.
- Produce per-floor scaling tables for enemy stats and spawn budgets (multiples of 5).
- Create sample 5×5 floor generator tests to guarantee solvability.
- Implement generator skeleton: create a TypeScript module under `src/game/` exposing `createRng`, `generateFloor`, `validateFloor`, and types. See `docs/13-generator.md` for the implementation plan and API.

Add tasks as issues or a project board for tracking.
